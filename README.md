## Brief Description
Implementation for Greedy Best-First Search path finding in Pacman. This repository contains codes, assets, and environment settings for game development in Unity and Anaconda. The GBFS implementation is run on a python API that is called in the movement class for ghosts. This implementation helps the ghost determine the best movement direction to chase the player, but the cross-language implementation seems to cause heavy performance issues.
